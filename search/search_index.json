You will then be interviewed by the probation department. This interview is called an intake. During the intake, someone in the Probation Intake Unit will determine the next steps for your case. When you are brought in to speak to the Probation Officer (P.O.), remember that you have rights. The P.O. should immediately advise you of your right to remain silent, and your right to have a lawyer present with you. However, the intake interview SHOULD NOT BE about your guilt or fault.</p> <p>The Probation Intake Unit can do one of the following things:</p> <ul> <li>Release you without the need to follow-up</li> <li>Release you with a written promise to appear in court</li> <li>Refer you to a program or services</li> <li>Place you on informal probation (define here)</li> <li>Begin the process of taking your case through the court system</li> </ul> <p>*Note: Whether or not you are allowed to go home after the intake interview depends on how serious your crime is and facts about you. The probation department takes things into consideration like if it\u2019s your first time being arrested, or if you have family at home that can make sure you appear in court for any assigned hearing.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what you can expect during the intake process: - Probation will fingerprint you, take your photo, and take a DNA sample (by hair sample or a swab). Your information will go into an electronic database that is shared by city, county, and federal officials. - Next, you will be screened for any illness or diseases and searched for weapons. After that, you will take a shower, then you will \u201cdress out\u201d in Juvenile Hall clothing. - Also a part of your intake interview is to figure out where you will need to be housed if you go into Juvenile Hall. Your location in Juvenile Hall depends on your:    - Age    - Height    - Weight    - Prior Offenses    - Mental health needs</p> <ul> <li>They will determine your grade level in school, so they can provide you with the right kind of school work assignments.</li> <li>Mental health screening is also something you will go through. You will take a survey of 52 yes-or-no questions that will help determine if you have any mental health needs of concern that need to be considered. The questions will take about 10-15 minutes to answer. Those questions include things like alcohol use, depression, anxiety, anger, traumatic experiences, and suicidal thoughts.</li> <li>A nurse or doctor will screen you for any health problems they should know about. Any serious health issues they find need to be treated at that time. The Police are required to take you to the hospital for any urgent care BEFORE you can be taken into custody.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Help-Me/Intake/Officers-Options/","title":"Officer's Options","text":"<p>In making the decision regarding where to send you after temporary custody, the police officer must prefer the alternative that least restricts your freedom of movement, while being compatible with your best interests and those of the community[^1].

If you are referred to Citation Diversion, you should receive a notification letter in the mail with your hearing date, ticket number, and where to appear. The program is housed in only one location in Van Nuys, where a single probation officer hears all cases. The most likely outcome of these hearings are fines or community service hours.
