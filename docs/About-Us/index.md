# About

## Goal
The Youth Justice Navigator’s goal is to create a tool for youth to navigate the Juvenile Justice System in Los Angeles County. Through this tool, we will educate and provide resources for youth to access information that is relevant in dealing with the criminal justice system. 
This site will help youth and their families to learn their rights when they come into contact with law enforcement, the different types of hearings that take place, and who the various people in the courtroom are.

## History
The project was first launched through the Youth & Justice Clinic at UCLA School of Law, as the Knowledge is Power project.  It grew to include Golden Gate University (GGU) School of Law and both GGU and UCLA approached Code for America for partnership. In turn, Code for America approached their local chapter, Hack for LA. Together, all four entities will bring their respective expertise to bring this tool to the community.
