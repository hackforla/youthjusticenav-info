# Join the Collabathon

In our three day collabathon we will be building project plans, prototypes, and applications that help youth and their families understand legal content found on the pages of this site.  

The creative concepts and work that comes from the collabathon will live side by side with the legal content.

## üëß‚úäüßí Help our children and youth! 
Do you want to help others?  Come join the Youth Justice Collabathon üëã!

## ü§î What is the Youth Justice Collabathon?
The Youth Justice Collabathon is an opportunity for others to work together on improving the juvenile legal system for youths. 

## ‚úçÔ∏è What project will you be working on?
The project will focus on helping to make the juvenile legal system accessible and easier to understand for youths and their families, which is very complex. We are working on a website that explains how the system works. However, it's still very hard for youths to understand this information in written form. So, we need your help to make this information easier to digest. 

## ü§≤ Who can join the Youth Justice Collabathon?
- Product Managers
- Designers
- Researchers
- Application/Website/Game Developers
- Problem-Solvers
- Writers
- Students (High School to Higher Ed.)
- Formerly Incarcerated/Systems Impacted Youth

### How will my work impact incarcerated youth? 
This project is focused on improving the learning process for Youths to understand the juvenile system. The work that you do for this project will impact the lives of Youths all across LA. 


### Is this in-person or online? 
We will hold both in person and remote versions of the collabathon to determine what produces the best results.

### How do I find a team?  
We are accepting applications from groups and individuals.  We will help people form a team if they are applying as an individual.

### Can I add this to my resume?   Will there be a certificate of participation? 
Yes! This is an experience! You can add this experience on your resume, LinkedIn, etc. At the end of this project, you will also receive a certificate of your participation in this project, which you can share with your school or on your LinkedIn profile.

### How many hours are required?  
Each of the three days is 8 hours. 

### How is this different from a hackathon?
In a Hackathon, you are not supposed to work on the project before the hackathon starts.
Each team decides if they want to continue after a hackathon is over, but the hackathon organizers don't keep working with the volunteers on the projects.  At the Collabathon we will take the project plans, prototypes, and applications that are built and either continue working with the volunteers or add future development of what was created to our development plan.There is no judging or prizes.

### I only know about building software, can I still participate?
Yes! We will have subject-matter experts there to answer your questions, from lawyers to system impacted youth.
