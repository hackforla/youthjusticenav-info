If you are temporarily detained and not released home or diverted, then you will be taken to
juvenile hall to meet with a probation officer.
You will then be interviewed by the probation department. This interview is called an intake.
During the intake, someone in the Probation Intake Unit will determine the next steps for your
case. When you are brought in to speak to the Probation Officer (P.O.), remember that you have
rights. The P.O. should immediately advise you of your right to remain silent, and your right to
have a lawyer present with you. However, the intake interview SHOULD NOT BE about your
guilt or fault.

The Probation Intake Unit can do one of the following things:

- Release you without the need to follow-up
- Release you with a written promise to appear in court
- Refer you to a program or services
- Place you on informal probation (define here)
- Begin the process of taking your case through the court system

_*Note: Whether or not you are allowed to go home after the intake interview depends on how
serious your crime is and facts about you. The probation department takes things into
consideration like if it’s your first time being arrested, or if you have family at home that can
make sure you appear in court for any assigned hearing._

Here’s what you can expect during the intake process:
- Probation will fingerprint you, take your photo, and take a DNA sample (by hair
sample or a swab). Your information will go into an electronic database that is shared by
city, county, and federal officials.
- Next, you will be screened for any illness or diseases and searched for weapons. After
that, you will take a shower, then you will “dress out” in Juvenile Hall clothing.
- Also a part of your intake interview is to figure out where you will need to be housed if
you go into Juvenile Hall. Your location in Juvenile Hall depends on your:
   - Age
   - Height
   - Weight
   - Prior Offenses
   - Mental health needs

- They will determine your grade level in school, so they can provide you with the right
kind of school work assignments.
- Mental health screening is also something you will go through. You will take a survey of
52 yes-or-no questions that will help determine if you have any mental health needs of
concern that need to be considered. The questions will take about 10-15 minutes to
answer. Those questions include things like alcohol use, depression, anxiety, anger,
traumatic experiences, and suicidal thoughts.
- A nurse or doctor will screen you for any health problems they should know about.
Any serious health issues they find need to be treated at that time. The Police are required
to take you to the hospital for any urgent care BEFORE you can be taken into custody.
