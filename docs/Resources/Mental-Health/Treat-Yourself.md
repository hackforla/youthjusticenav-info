#### Treat Yourself
Treating yourself is very important to your own physical and mental health. This doesn’t mean spending lots of money everywhere and anywhere you go. What treating yourself means is if you want a pedicure, get it. Or you can do the pedicure on yourself, and paint your nails. If you want to get your lashes done, pay that extra expense to make sure you look good and feel good about yourself. Or others might treat themselves with a nice dinner at a restaurant. Or even make a nice dinner for yourself if you can’t go to a restaurant. Treating yourself means to spend that extra money on an expense that will make you feel good about yourself and happy. Don’t feel guilty about treating yourself.
#### Treat yourself to a meal
Sometimes you need food to feel better. You can make food that you really enjoy, watch youtube videos that teach you a new recipe or make something you used to eat as a kid. Treating yourself to a meal is self care. You are feeding your body and treating yourself. Cooking can teach you to be patient, you can reflect when you cook and it can help you get time for yourself.
