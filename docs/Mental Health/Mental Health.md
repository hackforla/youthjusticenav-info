#### Mental Health
Times like these are hard and learning to navigate through the system is even harder. It is ok to feel overwhelmed, anxious, stressed out and scared. You are human, you have emotions and you should be able to show them and deal with them. It is very important that you put yourself first throughout this process. Just like you have to hold it down for yourself in court and in life, it is important you hold it down for yourself mentally. Don't let other people's ideas on mental health affect you. Helping the world and others can be so draining. If you don't put your mental health first, you won’t be able to help others with their struggles. Don’t be afraid to say no for your own sanity. Be selfish when it comes to your mental health and put yourself first.

#### Importance of Sleep 
Getting enough sleep means that you are letting your body heal and relax. Sleep helps create a healthy lifestyle for your body, after a long day of work your body needs to heal itself and prepare for what the next day holds. I believe that getting enough sleep helps with your brain and your thought process. 

#### Positive Affirmations
Positive affirmations were disregarded in the culture that I was brought up in, put downs were an everyday thing and so I became accustomed to always putting people down  and with that came putting myself down. It wasn’t until I accepted positive affirmations and started giving them to people that I began to grow and heal. Some things you can do for positive affirmations is telling yourself you are proud of yourself, looking in the mirror and telling yourself, “I am worthy of good things”, “I forgive myself for my mistakes”, “I am deserving of love, happiness, health and peace”. You can also try to complement a stranger everyday to put out positive affirmations.

#### Alone Time
It is important to set time for yourself, to relax, watch a show or just think. You could take a drive by the beach, listen to music or take a walk. Sitting at home and meditating is also very calming and peaceful. Alone time can help you find peace within yourself because you don't have to worry about others judging you. We always try to make other people happy, so with alone time we only have to worry about making ourselves happy.

#### Set Realistic Goals
Decide what you want to achieve academically, professionally or personally, and write down the steps you need to achieve your goals. Aim high, but be realistic and don't over-schedule. You'll enjoy a tremendous sense of accomplishment and self-worth as you progress toward your goal. Don’t forget to add time for yourself as you work toward your goals and to be proud of your progress.

#### How to Talk to a Therapist
It’s hard to understand your feelings, especially when there are so many things that you are worried about. That's why it is important to look for a therapist if you feel like you need one. With a therapist you can talk about your feelings, even just saying things out loud to a therapist can help you. Don’t be afraid to tell a therapist something, because you might get in trouble. Therapists have to keep confidentiality which means they cannot tell someone what happened during your session, unless you threaten to hurt yourself or someone else. When talking to a therapist, you can talk to them like if they were your friend and they will hear you out and give advice and ways to help yourself. There are free resources for therapists below.
