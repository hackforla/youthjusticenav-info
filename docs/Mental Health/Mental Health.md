### Mental Health
Times like these are hard and learning to navigate through the system is even harder. It is ok to feel overwhelmed, anxious, stressed out and scared. You are human, you have emotions and you should be able to show them and deal with them. It is very important that you put yourself first throughout this process. Just like you have to hold it down for yourself in court and in life, it is important you hold it down for yourself mentally. Don't let other people's ideas on mental health affect you. Helping the world and others can be so draining. If you don't put your mental health first, you won’t be able to help others with their struggles. Don’t be afraid to say no for your own sanity. Be selfish when it comes to your mental health and put yourself first.
