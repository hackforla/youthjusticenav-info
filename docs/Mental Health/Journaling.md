#### Journaling Prompts
For many years I found myself struggling to understand myself and my thought process. It wasn't until I was introduced to journaling  that I found an outlet to express myself and better understand my thought  process. Maybe journaling can also help you. Here are some journaling prompts if you want to get started:
- Talk About Your Day.
- Identify Things You're Grateful For.
- Write a List of Your Coping Mechanisms.
- Describe a Goal.
- Write About How Different You Were 5 Years Ago.
- Write a Letter to Your Body.
- List and Describe Your Emotions.
