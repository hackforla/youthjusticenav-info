#### Treat Yourself
Treating yourself is very important to your own physical and mental health. This doesn’t mean spending lots of money everywhere and anywhere you go. What treating yourself means is if you want a pedicure, get it. Or you can do the pedicure on yourself, and paint your nails. If you want to get your lashes done, pay that extra expense to make sure you look good and feel good about yourself. Or others might treat themselves with a nice dinner at a restaurant. Or even make a nice dinner for yourself if you can’t go to a restaurant. Treating yourself means to spend that extra money on an expense that will make you feel good about yourself and happy. Don’t feel guilty about treating yourself.
