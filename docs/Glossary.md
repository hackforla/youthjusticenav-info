## Here are a list of terms used throughout this website

- Adjudication: An adjudication is when you go to court and the juvenile
court judge decides you broke the law. It is not a conviction.

- Collateral Consequences: Collateral consequences are the ways that
your juvenile record can create challenges for you as you move forward
with your life, like getting a job, applying for college, finding a place to
live, joining the military, or simply obtaining a driver’s license.

- Defense Lawyer: Your defense lawyer is the lawyer who defended
you in your juvenile case, who may have been from the public defender’s
office or appointed by the judge. This person’s job is to be sure the court
hears your perspective in your juvenile case. Your lawyer may also be able
to help you after your case is over.

- Delinquent Act: If you are under 17 and you’re accused of breaking
the law, you are accused of a delinquent act, not a crime — as long as
your case is in juvenile court.

- Disposition: A disposition in juvenile court is similar to a sentence in
adult court. The disposition in your case is what the judge requires you
to do because the judge decided that you broke the law. Your disposition
could include probation, attending a treatment program, paying money,
or being sent to a juvenile facility.

- Juvenile Record: Your juvenile record includes the court and police
paperwork related to your juvenile case.

- Sealing: If your juvenile record is sealed, it means that the records will
be closed and no one can look at them without a special court order.
