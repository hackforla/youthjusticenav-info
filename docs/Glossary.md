## Here are a list of terms used throughout this website


- 
- Adjudication: An adjudication is when you go to court and the juvenile
court judge decides you broke the law. It is not a conviction.

- Allegation: Something that someone says has happened.

- Charge: The law that the police believe the defendant has broken.

- Complaint: A statement to the police accusing someone of breaking the law.

live, joining the military, or simply obtaining a driver’s license.

- Continuance: Put off trial until another time.

- Cross-examine: Questioning of a witness by the lawyer for the other side.

- Defense Lawyer: Your defense lawyer is the lawyer who defended
you in your juvenile case, who may have been from the public defender’s

hears your perspective in your juvenile case. Your lawyer may also be able
to help you after your case is over.

the law, you are accused of a delinquent act, not a crime — as long as
your case is in juvenile court.

- Delinquent Child: What a child found guilty of breaking the law is called in juvenile court.

- Disposition: A disposition in juvenile court is similar to a sentence in
adult court. The disposition in your case is what the judge requires you

be closed and no one can look at them without a special court order.

- Statement: A description about what happened that a witness gives to the police and that police write down.
