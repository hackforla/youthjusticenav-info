# Officer's Options
In making the decision regarding where to send you after temporary custody, the police officer must prefer the alternative that least restricts your freedom of movement, while being compatible with your best interests and those of the community[^1]. If you are charged with an offense in a group home, but have a suitable placement order preventing you from being released to your family home, you will be placed in detention. 

Note: If your exchange with an officer gets serious, and you think they are going to take you into custody, ALWAYS request to be referred to “diversion,” where you can protect yourself from entering the system in the first place (see YDD & Diversion for more info).

After you have been taken into custody, the law enforcement officer has the discretion to do one of the following options:

## Give you a warning and release you
Give you a warning to stay out of trouble and release you without a citation[^2]. If this happens, there is no need to go to court.

## Refer you to a diversion program, shelter, or counseling program
Refer you to a diversion program, shelter, or counseling program if the city or county has an agreement to provide such services[^3]. Diversion programs are opportunities for the matter to be handled informally, without involving the formal juvenile court. With you and your parents’ or guardians’ permission, the police may directly enroll you into a diversion program if you qualify. Once the program is finished, all charges and records will be sealed (see DYD & Diversion for more info)[^4]. 

## Give you a Notice to Appear and release you
Give you a "notice to appear" at court and let you go home[^5]. The notice to appear states where and when to go to resolve the incident, and provides a concise statement of why you were taken into custody. The courthouse you go to may be one of the following[^6]:

### Compton Courthouse
200 West Compton Blvd.<br>
Compton, CA 90220
 
### East Los Angeles Courthouse
4848 E. Civic Center Way<br>
Los Angeles, CA 90022
 
### Eastlake Juvenile Court
1601 Eastlake Avenue<br>
Los Angeles, CA 90033
 
### Governor George Deukmejian Courthouse
275 Magnolia<br>
Long Beach, CA 90802
 
### Inglewood Juvenile Courthouse
110 Regent Street<br>
Inglewood, CA 90301
 
### Michael D. Antonovich Antelope Valley Courthouse
42011 4th Street West<br>
Lancaster, CA 93534
 
### Pomona Courthouse South
400 Civic Center Plaza<br>
Pomona, CA 91766
 
### Sylmar Juvenile Courthouse
16350 Filbert Street<br>
Sylmar, CA 91342

## Send you to Citation Diversion
Starting in 2012, all law enforcement agencies in LA County were instructed to cite youths with non-traffic infraction tickets and low-level misdemeanor cases (such as trespassing, riding your skateboard without a helmet, and marijuana-related offenses) to the Probation Department’s Citation Diversion Program. 
If you are referred to Citation Diversion, you should receive a notification letter in the mail with your hearing date, ticket number, and where to appear. The program is housed in only one location in Van Nuys, where a single probation officer hears all cases. The most likely outcome of these hearings are fines or community service hours. You are not entitled to a lawyer at these hearings, but there are certain non profits you can reach out to who may be able to represent you. 
You can contact the Public Defender’s office for any Citation Diversion case charged as misdemeanor, not an infraction; Public Counsel if you are system involved (foster, delinquency, or probation youth) at 213-385-2977 ext. 500; or UCLA Law Criminal Justice Program’s Youth Justice Policy Lead Leah Gasser-Ordaz at 213-373-3163. 
If you do not show up to your hearing you will be cited with a “Failure to Appear'' charge and your driver’s license may be suspended, so it is very important to show up to your hearing. If you are innocent and want to fight the ticket you will likely come back again another month and have to present your case. 

## Bring you to Juvenile Hall
If you are brought to juvenile hall[^7], they must take immediate steps to notify your parent(s) or guardian(s) about where you are[^8]. (Please see the next chapter on probation intake for more information).
